This is JQuery version of the classic of Pig Dice.  I specifically coded the game to include either two players or a computer opponent. 
Each player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold". If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues unless the player chooses to hold. When a player holds, the player's turn total is added to the player's score and it is the second players turn to roll the dice. 

The first player to score 100 or more points wins. View Project [https://doohinkus.github.io/pig-dice/]
